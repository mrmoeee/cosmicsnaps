CosmicSnaps is an image hosting site inspired by 500px. A place where astronauts can share their cosmic related captures.

I designed and built this project within a two-week timeframe.

This is project utilizes React.js and Redux on the front end, Rails and PostgreSQL on the backend.
I plan to refactor my code, and keep on adding improvements in the future.
